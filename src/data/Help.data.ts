This is also critical to survival and early detection, and the medical community in the U.S. is seeing huge successes through patient navigation programs. The Caridad Program is a proactive approach to helping patients overcome the barriers of cost, fear, and misinformation surrounding a disease and its prevention. By helping underserved women to navigate the healthcare system, navigators provide the vision that gives women hope.",

      "Our support group creates a safe space for healthy dialogue between patients & survivors. Caridad hosts a monthly support group where our support group facilitator works with cancer survivors during “caring and sharing” time to encourage healthy dialogue and education for everyone involved. Having the support of others is an important part of breast cancer survivorship. Research shows that taking part in support groups, where you both give and receive help, is an effective way to reduce the stress and anxiety that can come with a breast cancer diagnosis.",
